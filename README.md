# GoogleImagesDownloader

This repository can download images from google with specified keywords

## Requirements

- python 3.5
- selenium 3.6.0
- Firefox
- geckodriver

**Firefox and geckodriver are required by selenium, and Firefox 55 or greater is recommended, cause [geckodriver][1] support that best. As for geckodriver, just download the latest version of geckodriver from [here][2], then add it to the PATH environment variable.**

Here is an example of downloading with selenium using 2 processes

## Details and Configuration

### Two Methods

Two different methods are provided

- `download_with_urllib`
- `download_with_selenium`


`download_with_urllib` is to download with just package `urllib`, but due to the limit by google, each searching query can download at most 100 images

`download_with_selenium` is to download with package `selenium` and `urllib`, with selenium, we can directly search and scroll in the browser, so we can get more than 100 images for each searching query

**Both of the above methods support downloading with single process or mulitple processes**, and `download_with_selenium` will firstly store the actual links of images in a file, then download the actual images with the file, while `download_with_urllib` will directly download all the images since the number if small

**Specify `main_keywords` and `supplemented_keywords` in the code**, each `main_keyword` will join with each `supplemented_keyword` to become a searching query, and one directory will be created for each main_keyword to store the related images.The following image is a simple example

### Download With Time Limit

As to the script `download_images_with_time_limit.py`, it is a replacement of the method `download_images` in script `download_with_selenium.py`, because the method `download_images` will always block due to network issue, so I add restriction that each http request can cost at most 10 sceonds, and that is what `download_images_with_time_limit.py` does. 

Pay attention that the time-limited strategy is to use the signal that system provides, and here the `SIGALRM` in unix-like system is adopted, so this script should run with unix-like system rather than Windows. However, the network blocking thing happened when I ran the script in my network, but not sure whether this will happen in yours, so you can test with `download_with_selenium.py` firstly, if the downloading task blocks, change to the script `download_images_with_time_limit.py`
